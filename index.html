                        Welcome to my portfolio! If oyu dont know me here are somthings about me. I love dogs, pizza, and I love to travel as of right now i have been to 150 countries and I love to fly drones. I have my High School diploma from Wellsvile High School go Eagles. After High School I did not go to college right away instead I took a year and half to travel. When I got back from traveling I got my Part 107 Pilots license for drones and I started my own Drone mapping and photography business. I guess you can say I am a non-traditional student.

                        With growing up in a family and having a mom that works in the tech industry. I grew up loving technology and working with computers. When I was young I started teaching my self how to build computers. But what really got interested in coding was the class I took in High School. That class had a major impact on my life because I found something that I was good at and enjoyed doing it. So that is why I am going to the KU Coding BootCamp.

                        When I am not working, I am usually working out or playing games on my xbox. But my favorite passtime is going to the lake and taking my paddle board for a couple of hours just to relax and reset for the next day. If you need anything or just need to get in contact with me, please use the contact page and I will get back to you as soon as possible.
