# 02_Responsive_Portfolio

# The Project Goal

The goal for this project was to make a Responsive Portfolio page utilizing the Bootstrap CSS Framework so the page would be usable on a variety of decives and screen sizes. The end result or solution was for us to have a index.html page a portfolio.html page and a contact.html page and all three pages had to link to each other, and all three pages had to be repsonsive. I learned from this project that using bootstrap may be fun and easy you are limted to bootstrap and there predefined CSS styles.
