# 02_Responsive_Portfolio
The Project Goal

    The goal for this project was to make a Responsive Portfolio page utilizing the Bootstrap CSS Framework so the page would be usable on a variety of decives and screen sizes. The end result or solution was for us to have a index.html page a portfolio.html page and a contact.html page and all three pages had to link to each other.

 About Page

    For this page I wrote a breif but imformative description about my self and put in a portiat of myself. Then I made sure that the page was responsive and that the text would wrap around the image when the screen was smaller. 

Portfolio Page
